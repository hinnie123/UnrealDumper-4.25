### About
This fork of the original UnrealDumper adds support for the dumps.host dumps format. After dumping a game there will be a "Dumps.host" folder in the output directory, with JSON files that can be uploaded to dumps.host.

### Adding a dump to dumps.host
Go to https://dumps.host/profile and click "Add custom dump". Give the dump an url and upload the dumped JSON files. After adding a dump wait for me to manually verify it, so I can make sure no one is trying to do some funny business.
